        <h2>About me</h2>
        <img src="http://lorempixel.com/400/200/sports/Dummy-Text/" alt="place holder">
        <p>Hello my name is Tyler Millner and I am from Las Vegas. I have 6 brothers and grew up loving sports. I moved
            to
            Utah about 2 years ago
            and have since been married with a child on the way. My wife and I were married in the Provo City Center
            temple
            and it was the absolute best day of my life.
            I have been coding for about 3 months now and absolutely love it. I really enjoy the challenge of the work
            and
            the huge reward you feel when you create something that works the way you intended it too.
            Before i began coding I was a reptile breeder in Las Vegas. Secretly i have a huge passion for reptiles, but
            I
            love snakes.
            Currently I own a Mangrove monitor which is basically a much smaller version of a komodo Dragon. I also own
            a
            Green Tree Python and a Green Anaconda.
            I know what you are thinking "is it going to be huge and eat you some day??!" Yes it is going to get rather
            large but no I dont plan on letting it eat me anytime soon.
        </p>
        <p>Looking into the future I can see myself being a very skilled full time programmer with the goal of owning my
            own
            company someday.
            Prior to entering this course I didnt have much coding experience. I had some breif exposures to it from
            friends
            that were programmers and the occational missclick on the inspect programmer but nothing like this.
            When i initally start this course I wasnt sure what I really expected from it or what I really wanted to
            gain
            but after getting started and seeing what its really all about I know that this is what i want to do.
            I am hard working and extremely deticated to finding a job not only in this field but one that brings the
            best
            out of me and challenges me to be the best that i can be.
            I want to work somewhere that expects the best out of me each and everyday and that can enjoy what they do
            while
            doing.
            I want to work for someone who loves their work and wants to make the best site anyone has ever seen
            everytime
            they are asked to create one. Do i expect that to be the case? No, but I do want that to be the standard.
            Thank you so much for taking the time to learn a little about me and reading through this.
            If a hard working programmer who loves what they do and expects the best from himself each and everyday is
            what
            your company needs feel free to contact me
            Thanks again!
